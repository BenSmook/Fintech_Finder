# Fintech Finder Challenge

## Introduction

In this challenge, you will use two Python files to create a web interface for a fintech application that interacts with the Ethereum blockchain. The files are: 
- `fintech_finder.py` - contains the code for the web interface of the application, which is built with the Streamlit library.
- `crypto_wallet.py` - contains the Ethereum transaction functions that you will use in the fintech application.

## Objectives

The following tasks will be accomplished in this challenge:

1. Generate a new Ethereum account instance using the mnemonic seed phrase provided by Ganache.
2. Fetch and display the account balance associated with the Ethereum account address.
3. Calculate the total value of an Ethereum transaction, including the gas estimate, that pays a Fintech Finder candidate for their work.
4. Digitally sign a transaction that pays a Fintech Finder candidate and send it to the Ganache blockchain.
5. Review the transaction hash code associated with the validated blockchain transaction.

## Instructions

1. In the `fintech_finder.py` file, integrate the `crypto_wallet.py` script using import statements.
2. Use the Ethereum transaction functions in the `crypto_wallet.py` script to complete the tasks listed in the "Objectives" section.
3. Navigate to the Transactions section of Ganache to review the details of the blockchain transaction.
4. Save screenshots of the transaction in the `README.md` file of your GitHub repository for this challenge assignment.

## Conclusion

Upon completion of this challenge, you will have a working web interface for a fintech application that can interact with the Ethereum blockchain.
